### Hey there!

I'm Sreenitya, a Computer Science undergraduate at IIT Jodhpur.

I like to build stuff - mostly full stack apps - and I really enjoy making small, fun projects that feel lightweight but useful.

Things I usually build:
- End-to-end web apps
- Small side projects just for fun
- Interactive tools and mini-products like photobooths, productivity tools, meme search engines, and other experiments

My main tech stack is:
- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js

I enjoy working on ideas that are simple, playful, and fast to ship. If something sounds fun, I’ll probably try to build it.

Fun facts:
- I like coffee
- I love sleeping
- Big fan of bedrotting and watching TV

Most of my repositories are experiments, side projects, or things I wanted to try out. Feel free to explore.
